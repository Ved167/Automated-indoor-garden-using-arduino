# Automated-indoor-garden-using-arduino
This project is about an Automated indoor garden which takes care of garden in the absence of the owner. Due to working families, it becomes diificult for them to take care of their gardens and so they avoid gardening. But by this project, they can ensure that their garden is fully safe and something is taking care of that in their absence. When the water level drops, the water pump starts, when the temperature of the surrounding increase, cooling effect starts and when light level drops, artificial lights are turned on.

To meet these requirements, we will be using arduino uno board,arduino programming, DE10 Lite board and VHDLÂ programming.
